    {
      q: "Can I migrate from Memos or flomo?",
      a: "Yes. FlareMo imports ZIP or JSON export bundles from Memos and flomo, preserving timestamps, tags, and content while allowing custom conflict resolution.",

    {
      q: "Do third-party apps and scripts still work?",

      q: "How does single-user differ from team mode?",
      a: "By default, it is a quiet single-user sanctuary. When team mode is enabled, admins invite members via one-time activation links. Memos can be private, team-visible, or public.",
