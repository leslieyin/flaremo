/**
 * Best-effort client-side transcode before upload
 * (docs/image-compression-design.md, docs/audio-compression-research.md).
 * Compression is decoration, never a contract: every failure path returns
 * the original file untouched, and a transcode that does not actually shrink
 * the payload is discarded. Audio additionally refuses to transcode when the
 * browser cannot play Ogg Opus back, or when the decoded PCM would exceed the
 * memory budget — an unplayable or tab-killing attachment is worse than a
 * large one.
 *
 * This module is the single hook-in for uploads; the two pipelines behind it
 * live in ./upload/{image-compression,audio-compression}, with the container
 * parsing in ./upload/audio-format and the engine probes in
 * ./upload/capabilities. Everything they export is re-exported here under the
 * same name, so importers keep seeing one module.

 *
 * The image branch checks the WebP encoder because that check is synchronous
 * and cheap — claiming compressibility on a browser that cannot encode WebP
 * (Safari, verified against real WebKit) would send the user through a long
 * upload the server then refuses. The audio capability proof is async and
 * costs a wasm instantiation, so it is not repeated here; the server's own cap
 * remains the backstop for the narrow case it cannot cover (a browser too old
 * to play back the Ogg it would produce, holding a >25 MiB lossless file).
